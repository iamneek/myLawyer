-- Mac OS like video player with custom controls --

Minutes = Math.floor(Video Duration / 60);
Seconds = Math.floor(video Duration - (Video Length in Minute * 60))

e.currentTarget = returns element which is targeted ( event triggered )

e.clientX = gave the X position of the mouse as our timeline is horizontal so we need to get the X position of mouse so that we can then
make the progress bar reach to that point (so that the video goes forward or backwards )

timeline.getBoundingClientRect().left = gives the position from the very left side to timeline to where ever in the timeline the user cicks

timeline.offsetWidth = gives the width of the timeline

video.currentTime = gives the current time of video 

vid_ref.current = current element pointed by the vid_ref ref
